## Technical Implementation

### Code Quality Configuration Files

**SpotBugs Configuration:**
- `src/main/resources/spotbugs-include.xml`: Security and correctness patterns
- `src/main/resources/spotbugs-exclude.xml`: Development-friendly exclusions

**Checkstyle Configuration:**
- `src/main/resources/checkstyle.xml`: Google Java Style Guide with customizations
- 4-space indentation for Java files
- Line length limit of 120 characters
- Comprehensive naming conventions

**PMD Configuration:**
- `src/main/resources/pmd-ruleset.xml`: Best practices and security rules
- Custom rules for version handling
- Test file exclusions for practical development

### Maven Profiles

**Release Profile (`-Prelease`):**
- Activates all quality tools
- Generates comprehensive build metadata
- Enforces Maven and Java version requirements
- Creates detailed reporting

**Development Profile (default):**
- Skips quality checks for faster builds
- Enables rapid development cycles
- Maintains test execution

### Build Enhancements

**JAR Manifest (Release Mode):**
```
Implementation-Title: XStr.me API Specification
Implementation-Version: 0.0.1-alpha
Implementation-Vendor: XStr.me
Built-By: [user]
Build-Timestamp: [ISO timestamp]
Git-Branch: [current branch]
Git-Commit: [full commit hash]
Java-Version: [runtime version]
Maven-Version: [build version]
```

**Quality Thresholds:**
- JaCoCo Code Coverage: 90% minimum
- SpotBugs: High priority bugs fail build
- Checkstyle: All violations fail build
- PMD: Rule violations fail build

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Constructor Tests**: Reflection-based private constructor validation
- **Availability Tests**: Resource existence and accessibility
- **Stream Tests**: Resource management and content validation
- **String Tests**: Content parsing and null safety
- **Version Tests**: Dynamic version resolution and fallbacks
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Response time benchmarking

### Quality Validation
```bash
# Development build (fast)
mvn clean test

# Release build (full quality checks)
mvn clean test -Prelease

# Complete package build
mvn clean package -Prelease
```

## File Structure Changes

### New Configuration Files
```
