## Instruction Files Organization

This workspace uses multiple instruction files for different purposes:

### Core Instruction Files
- **windows-git.instructions.md**: Windows-specific commands, Git operations, and branch management
- **github-workflow.instructions.md**: GitHub CLI operations, issue/PR workflow, and validation procedures  
- **project-architecture.instructions.md**: Project structure, lifecycle management, and documentation standards

### Usage
Each instruction file contains specialized guidance:
- Use `windows-git.instructions.md` for OS-specific commands and Git operations
- Use `github-workflow.instructions.md` for GitHub integration and workflow processes
- Use `project-architecture.instructions.md` for project structure and development guidelines

All instruction files work together to provide comprehensive project guidance.
