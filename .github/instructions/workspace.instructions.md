## Operating System Detection
Always check if the user is on Windows or Linux before generating any commands or file paths:
- For Windows: Use PowerShell commands, backslash path separators (\), and Windows-specific tools
- For Linux: Use bash commands, forward slash path separators (/), and Linux-specific tools
- When in doubt, ask the user about their operating system
