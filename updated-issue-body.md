# Update Root Project Configuration for Better npm Ecosystem Integration

## Overview

This issue focuses on updating the root `package.json` and `pom.xml` files to improve integration
with npm ecosystem tools while maintaining the current Maven-based project structure.

## Objectives

1. **Enhance npm tooling integration** - Configure root package.json for better developer experience
2. **Improve development workflow** - Add Prettier, Husky, and other development tools at the root
   level
3. **Maintain current structure** - Keep all existing project locations unchanged

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Update root `package.json` with development dependencies and scripts
- Configure Maven `pom.xml` to work seamlessly with npm tools
- Add root-level configuration files for tools like Prettier, ESLint
- Set up pre-commit hooks with Husky
- Improve OpenAPI generation workflow integration

**Out of Scope:**

- Moving or restructuring existing project directories
- Changing Maven module locations
- Modifying current build processes significantly

## Implementation Plan

1. **Root package.json Updates**

   - Add development dependencies (prettier, husky, lint-staged, etc.)
   - Create npm scripts for common development tasks
   - Configure workspaces if beneficial for tooling

2. **Maven Integration**

   - Ensure Maven build process works with npm tooling
   - Configure any necessary Maven plugins
   - Maintain current Maven module structure

3. **Development Tooling**

   - Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
   - Set up Husky for Git hooks
   - Add lint-staged for pre-commit linting
   - Configure any additional quality tools

4. **Documentation**
   - Update README with new development workflow
   - Document new npm scripts and their usage

## Expected Benefits

- Improved developer experience with consistent tooling
- Better code quality with automated formatting and linting
- Streamlined OpenAPI generation workflow
- Enhanced pre-commit validation
- Better integration with modern JavaScript/TypeScript development practices

## Non-Goals

- This issue does NOT involve restructuring the project architecture
- No changes to existing Maven module locations
- No migration of existing functionality between projects
